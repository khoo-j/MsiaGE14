# Malaysian 14th general elections (2018)
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS: Analyzing Malaysia's 2018 General Elections data

In May 2018, Malaysia underwent a change of government, with the opposition toppling the ruling incumbent.

In this repository, I attempt to decipher what changed via machine learning. 

This is a pro-bono work.

Special thanks to: Dr Toh, DAP Malaysia, Tindak Malaysia (2018), SPR (2018), and Sinar Project for generously supplying the highly structured datasets.
